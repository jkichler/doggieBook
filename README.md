# DoggieBook

Doggie book allows owners to search and find other dogs in the neighborhood to join with on a walk.  

It was developed using React Native, Expo, and Firebase.

Users can sign in by creating an account or using Facebook Oauth.

Once logged in, uses set their state to walking and they get a list of other dogs walking nearby.

Dogs are presented using swippable cards.  When two owners swipe right, they can connect and message each other for a meet up location.
